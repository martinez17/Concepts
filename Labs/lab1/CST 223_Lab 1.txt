1.) Sent the constraints to the certain words
And be able add/subtract/multiple/divide the letter within the constraints
The constraints should add up to one constraint
Make an array or dictionary to store and then loop and multiply
The word that creates the constraint is multiplied by a power of 10 where the -
first letter is by the power of 10 to the place of the letter minus one - the last 
letter in the constraint is multiplied by one
And since these letters in the constraints are associated with numbers, you can pass them into - 
a function that can accept those constraint

2.) MiniZinc is neat with how you can tell it to solve
the a certain problem and it doesn't need a way to solve
it can be told to solve and solves it its own way. This language 
is sort of like python with all the modules you can add which imports 
certain libraries to make things easier. The way it does constraints for 
variables is like an if statement in c/c++ where if the variable is not within
scoop, it can display a message.

3.) Yes c/c++ can solves these problems but with more code required. For instance, 
the code that does the balance after each quarter with interest and repayment, that is all 
done in some nice and simple lines where c/c++ would need of course the declaration of the
variable but as some statements for self check. The output is easier in miniZn since 
for c/c++ you need to declare floats or ints that can store the answer to then display. Yes you can do 
the same in c/c++ where you can do the math in cout or print function but show func is easy.
